# tyding-data

In this repository, a script for tyding the data in the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) is provided, as per the requirements of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization. The files included are:

"run_analysis.R":

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- Generates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

"CodeBook.md":

Gives a detailed explanation of the variables, the data, and the transformations performed by the above script to tidy the data set.
